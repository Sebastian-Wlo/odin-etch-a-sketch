# odin-etch-a-sketch

This is my attempt at the "Etch-a-sketch" project from "The Odin Project" Foundations curriculum (full assignment's description can be[found here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch)).

## Project requirements

- A 16x16 grid of square divs generated with JavaScript,
- Positioning divs using Flexbox,
- Making the divs change colors when hovered over with mouse cursor, leaving a trail after it,
- Adding a button showing the user a popup asking for the grid size;
- - The popup should be created using `prompt`,
- - Once entered, the existing grid should be removed and replaced with a grid with the size entered in the popup (max size of the grid should be 100).

## Extra credit requirements

- Randomizing the squares' RGB values with each interaction,
- Implementing a progressive darkening effect where each interaction darkens the square by 10%.

### Additions

- A sound with randomised pitch playing when the cursor enters one of the grid squares,
- Volume controls and a mute button for the sounds,
- The animation for creating the grid; each square should "pop up" with an animation.
